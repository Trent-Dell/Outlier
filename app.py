IQR
Z-score (SD of 2, 3, or 4 depending on population size)
From  sci-kit learn
    One-Class Classification (OCC), since we'll be doing this for one feature at a time, this has a good likelihood of providing a useful result; may have to deviate if we want ID outliers by LOB, chassis, brand or family - but that's on down the road
    LocalOutlierFactor (LOF) class
    Isolation Forest
    Minimum Covariance Determinant
    One-Class SVM
